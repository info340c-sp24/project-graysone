            <h2>Data Domain</h2>
            <p>The Pacific Northwest has some of the most abundant and beautiful nature in all of the United States. Its no wonder then that hiking is such a popular and widespread activity
                for leisure in Washington. Despite the popularity of this activity, planning for hikes with a group of friends can quickly become a stressful experience. Information about 
                location, required permits, items to bring, and time to meet can quickly become overwhelming while planning for a hike. Currently, there is no website that can be used to 
                plan for a hike with a group of friends both simply and effectively. This lack of resources can discourage people from exploring the wonderful nature available to them, or to 
                do it without the company of good friends. Certain websites, such as the <a href="https://www.wta.org/go-outside/hikes" target="_blank">Washington Trail Association</a> provide useful 
                information about trail locations, conditions, length, and other details. While the WTA database is very useful when planning a hike, it does not allow for users to add their own 
                information into a page. This means that while the user can use the WTA database to get details of the hike, they will still need to go somewhere else to actually plan an event 
                related to that hike. Other trail databases such as <a href="https://www.alltrails.com/" target="_blank">Alltrails </a> have similar issues, as they do not provide the ability
                to plan a hike outside of details of the trail itself.

            <h2>App Description</h2>
            <section>
                <h3>App Users</h3>
                <p>The intended users of this app are people who are interested in organizing hikes to go on with their friends and family. Both new and veteran hikers would be able to use the site,
                    although Functionality would be slightly focused towards people with less experience hiking, as they would likely have the most trouble planning for a hike. Nonetheless, this app is 
                    intended to be accessible for all people, regardless of experience level.

                <h3>App Functionality and Information</h3>
                <p>This app will contain three primary features: </p>
                <p>
                    <em>Hike Event Creation: </em> Users will be able to create and save hike events. These events will allow users to provide information related to the hike that they are planning.
                    Required inputs would include the name of the hike, date and time of the hike, and address of the hike. Further inputs would include a link to the WTA page of the hike, suggested 
                    items to bring to the hike, number of people going on the hike, and any other planning information such as a group rendevouz point for traveling to the trail location. After creating 
                    a hike event, users will be able to share the page to those going on the hike. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    <em>Hike Event Organization: </em> This will be a page that contains all of the created events by a certain user. The user will be able to view and edit their event pages. Furthermore
                    users will be able to organize the events into created categories for organizational purposes. For example, a user could create a "family" category and a "friends" category. They could
                    then organize their events by whether they were created for hikes with their friends or their family. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    <em>Hike Interest Lists: </em> On this page, users will be able to create and share "interest lists". These lists will be user-generated lists akin to top five lists for hikes. For example,
                    a user could create a list with their favorite hikes, or hikes that they think have the best views, or hikes that they are most interested in going to. These lists could then be shared to 
                    other people, similar to hike events. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The primary information that users will be viewing will be generated by the users themselves. As stated in the features discussion, users will generate several different types of content that 
                    they will be able to manage and organize. Primary items include Hike events and Hike interest lists. While users will primarily be viewing content generated by themselves or their acquaintances, 
                    that content will be modified to look visually appealing and easy to read. 
                </p>

            <section>
                <h3>Problem Solution</h3>
                <p>This web app will solve the proposed problem by providing people with a hike management tool that will make it much easier to plan hikes with people. This web app will allow someone to centralize
                    all of the information around a hike to a single page, which will reduce stress for the person planning the event. This will make it easier for people to plan hikes and enjoy the abundant nature 
                    in the Pacific Northwest. Furthermore, the hike interest list feature will allow people to share further hikes that they are interested in going on, further promoting outdoor activity and social engagement.
