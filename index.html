                Welcome to Hike Helper, a new website that will help you plan hikes, and share those plans with friends and family! This website has 
                three primary features, those being:

                <li>
                    The Event creator: Allows you to create hiking events. These events will contain information about an upcoming hike you have planned, 
                    and provide a simple way to share that information with the people you plan to hike with!

                    The Event Organizer: Allows you to view and organize your created hiking events. This feature will also allow you to organize 
                    your existing hiking events into various categories for better organization.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The Interest List Creator: Allows you to create interest lists based on hikes you have gone on or would like to go to. You can then 
                    share your interest lists with friends and family to get them excited!
